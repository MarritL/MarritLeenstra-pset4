To-Do List

## Introduction
A simple to-do list app that has a list of tasks that the user needs to complete. Initially the app contains three sample to-do items 
that explain how the app works. If the user types text into a bottom input field and clicks an Add button, the new item will be added to 
the top of the list. Of course, users can mark items as “done”, and delete them as well! (Source: pset description by apps.mprog.nl)
